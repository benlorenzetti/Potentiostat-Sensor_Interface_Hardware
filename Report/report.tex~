\section*{Introduction}

BioMicroSystems (BMS) Lab is developing point-of-care electrochemical sensors for measuring heavy metal concentrations in environmental samples,
such as manganese in lake water \cite{bms-article}.

\begin{figure}[ht]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.9\columnwidth]{analytical-chemistry-copper-electrode}
\caption{Measuring Manganese \cite{bms-article}}
\end{figure}

Three electrodes are inundated in a sample and a potential is applied between two of the electrodes, while
a different pair of two electrodes is used to measure current.
At some applied voltage, an oxidation-reduction reaction occurs between the metal of interest and the working electrode surface.
Charge is emitted as the metal changing oxidation state;
so measuring and integrating the current gives the quantity of metal reagent in the sample.

In a three electrode system, one electrode must be common to both the voltage pair and the current pair,
and this is termed the counter electrode.
For the other two electrodes (reference and working) to accurately separate voltage and current,
they must be virtually grounded by amplifier electronics.
A device which drives the virtual ground, sets a potential, and measures resulting current is called a potentiostat.

\begin{figure}[ht]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.9\columnwidth]{zinc-paper-potentiostat}
\caption{Op-Amp Potentiostat \cite{zinc-masters-defense}}
\end{figure}

The possible advantages of the point-of-care electrodes being developed by BMS Lab include
low cost, portability, measurement speed, and simplicity for non-technical operators.
To realize these advantages, a small, portable potentiostat is needed with a simple user interface.

\newpage
%------------------------------------------------

\section*{Method}

An OEM potentiostat board measuring only 2" x 1.35" was purchased from PalmSens, called EmStat.
Also from PalmSens, a Multiplexer was purchased that allows EmStat to switch between multiple sensors.
The EmStat--Multiplexer connection and the external interface towards the sensors are shown in figure \ref{emstat}.

\begin{figure}[tb]
\centering
\subfloat[EmStat Potentiostat]{\includegraphics[width=0.45\columnwidth]{EmStat}}	\quad

\subfloat[Pinout Schematic]{\includegraphics[width=0.45\columnwidth]{MUX_Pinout_Schematic}}
\caption{EmStat and Multiplexer from PalmSens \cite{mux-documentation}}
\label{emstat}
\end{figure}

The external interface from the Multiplexer is a standard 0.1" header but the sensors are made to be inserted into a USB receptacle.
To make this simple for the end user,
a custom breakout board was made to fit in the space between the EmStat and Multiplexer boards;
see figure \ref{breakout-board-sandwich}

\begin{figure}[tb]
\centering
\subfloat[Breakout Board]{\includegraphics[width=0.4\columnwidth]{breakout-board}}	\quad
\subfloat[PCB Sandwich...tasty]{\includegraphics[width=0.5\columnwidth]{three-board-assembly}}
\caption{Breakout Board fits between EmStat and MUX}
\label{breakout-board-sandwich}
\end{figure}

The breakout board was designed in CadSoft Eagle and the \texttt{.brd} file was sent to OSH Park LLC for manufacture.
The Eagle project and part libraries used can be found in the directory \texttt{PCB\_Boards/}.
In addition to the manufactured board, the components listed in table \ref{breakout-board-bom} are need for assembly.

\begin{table}[ht]
\centering

\resizebox{\columnwidth}{!}{
\begin{tabular}{c | l | c}

\hline\hline
\end{tabular}
} % end resize box
\label{breakout-board-bom}
\end{table}

The x-y coordinates used in aligning the EmStat, Multiplexer, and breakout board are shown in appendix \ref{x-y-coordinates-appendix}.
The schematic diagram for the breakout board and a transparent view from Eagle are incluced in appendices \ref{breakout-board-schematic} and \ref{breakout-board-top-view}

The packaging was designed in SolidWorks to be 3D-printed in two parts: a base and a lid.
In addition to the base and lid, six size \#3-48, 1.25" long machine screws and \#3-48 tapping equipment are needed for assembly.
Instructions for tapping can be found in appendix \ref{tapping-appendix}.

\begin{table}[ht]
\centering
\caption{Assembly Components}
\resizebox{\columnwidth}{!}{
\begin{tabular}{c | l | c}

	&	loaded tap guide	&	appendix \ref{tapping-appendix}	\\
\hline\hline
\end{tabular}
} % end resize box
\label{breakout-board-bom}
\end{table}

The design of the packaging was tested and iterated in house using a Makerobt Replicator 2X with ABS filament.
Mechanical drawings of the base and lid and a list of revisions are included in appendix \ref{enclosure-drawings-appendix}.

For printing with MakerBot or an outside printing house,
the files \texttt{Enclosure\_Base.STL} and \texttt{Enclosure\_Lid.STL} are needed from the \texttt{Packaging/} directory.
For editing the parts, the SolidWorks files are located in the \texttt{Packaging/SolidWorks\_Files} subdirectory.

In addition to the potentiostat system, three small sensor interface boards were built.
One allows a USB-style sensor to be extended away from the potentiostat system by a USB male-A-to-male-mini cable.
Another allows USB-style sensors to be easily connected to the WaveNow potentiostat.
The third allows USB-style sensors to be connected to aligator clips for electroplating, etc.

%------------------------------------------------

\section*{Results}

The enclosure base and lid were printed several times in house on the MakerBot and once outside by Shapeways.
Printing with Shapeways cost ~\$60 and had a lead time of three weeks.
However, the result was a much nicer product, as shown in figure \ref{print-comparison}.

\begin{figure}[ht]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=1\columnwidth]{packaging-comparison}
\caption{Packaging Printed on MakerBot (left) and by Shapeways (right)}
\label{print-comparison}
\end{figure}

The parts printed by Shapeways had much more precision than the MakerBot,
to the extent that no hand filing or drilling had to be done just to get the parts to fit together.
The surface finish was also many times better.

Furthermore, tapping will be significantly better with the Shapeways base because the tolerance
for the through hole is much tighter and the enclosure is not hollow beyond the cylindrical face.

\section*{Conclusions}

All of the goals of the hardware are met by assembling the breakout board and 3D-printed
enclosure with the EmStat and Multiplexer boards from PalmSens.
For a higher quality product, it is recommended that the enclosure be reprinted
by an outside printing service such as Shapeways.

\section{Tapping Instructions}

The base part of the enclosure needs to be tapped six times--once for each assembly screw.
The screws have 3-48 threading,
which means they have an outermost diameter of 0.099" with 48 threads per inch.

The machine shop in 407 Rhodes has all of the tapping equipment needed.
Ron Hudepohl is very helpful and can show you where all the equipment is.

\begin{figure}[ht]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.7\columnwidth]{tapping-equipment}
\caption{Equipment for Tapping}
\end{figure}

It is much better to go to the shop than to purchase the tapping equipment because tapping
is easier if you can mount the enclosure and keep the tap vertically aligned.

If you mount the base part on mill with a digital x-y readout, figure \ref{tap-locations} will help.
